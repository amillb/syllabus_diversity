Steps to run on Google Cloud
See https://medium.com/@dmahugh_70618/deploying-a-flask-app-to-google-app-engine-faa883b5ffab

1. Download Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart
(I put it in Applications.) Skip Step B. Log in as directed.

If it times out, change the default browser to Chrome in System Preferences

2. Create a new project. This will then exit you from cloud.

3. Install app engine: 
./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud components install app-engine-python

4. Set project as default:
./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud config set project syllabusdiversity [or amb-projects]


5. Enable billing: https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project
Also set a budget alert

6. Enable API
./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

7. Upload files:
Navigate to the project folder
/Applications/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud  app deploy

8. If there are errors, look at the logs:
See link here: https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/troubleshoot-response-errors

9. Add custom domain: NOTE: this is superseded, now directs to ITS server
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/mapping-custom-domains 

10. To temporarily disable, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/settings and click Disable

11. UPDATE: home.html is now on the UCLA ITS server in order to avoid spinning up instances
